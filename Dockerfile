# MaxRAMPercentage: without it the JVM defaults to 25% of the container, so a 512 MiB instance ran
#   on a ~128 MB heap while the rest sat unused. 70% leaves room for metaspace, code cache, thread
#   stacks and direct buffers, which are not counted in the heap but are counted by Cloud Run.
# ExitOnOutOfMemoryError: an instance that has exhausted its heap cannot serve anything useful, and
#   left alive it lingers behind the load balancer returning 502s. Exiting lets Cloud Run replace it.
#
# Deliberately no HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError: /tmp is a tmpfs here, so the dump would be written
# into the very memory that just ran out.
